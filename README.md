# Employment-Rate

Our project aims to develop a robust regression model for predicting future unemployment rates in the USA, focusing on demographic factors such as gender and ethnicity. By leveraging a combination of descriptive statistics, inferential analysis, and data visualization techniques, we seek to uncover valuable insights into the complex dynamics of unemployment. The primary objectives of our study include:
Investigating the relationship between unemployment rates and demographic variables, particularly gender and ethnicity.
Identifying demographic groups with the most favorable job prospects.
Exploring potential factors or events contributing to observed trends in unemployment rates across various demographic segments.
Developing a predictive model to forecast future unemployment rates for different demographic groups, facilitating informed decision-making and policy planning.
